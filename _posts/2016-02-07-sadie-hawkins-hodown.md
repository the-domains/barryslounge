"When ah fires \[my gun\], all o' yo' kin start a-runnin! When ah fires agin---after givin' yo' a fair start---Sadie starts a runnin'. Th' one she ketches'll be her husbin."

We give you a top drawer soundtrack headed up by N London's own KITCHEN DRINKERS - how every party oughtta start & finish, with Mike & Sally sublimely singin up the sun, in fine, close harmony and with splendid musicianship for their country folk set.

ANNA WONDER - breaking away from The Wonders for just one night of stripped bare solo frolick & frenzy, Ms Anna Lucas fills the room w her big beautiful voice & petite mandolin, but is just as comfy rawkin the saloon w some sexy Strat. A pert package of sultry & sass just not to be missed

BARRY 'The Snakeoil Rattlers' WARREN is always walkin on the dark side in a constantly shifting landscape.... & lookin pretty damn good while he's doin it too. Mr Warren puts the 'raw' in RAWK w his own hothouse brand of southern fried literal realism... in songs with death rates higher than a disaster movie.

BITCHFORK - Marianne Hyatt is a deep Southern Songstress from Austin Texas - equal parts Patsy Cline, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison - & Chris Chesney is Tom Baker's doppelg√§nger, but imbued with the rockstar axe proclivities of Hendrix. Together they play platonic lovesongs to sexworkers, country reggae odes to schizophrenic madames and protest tunes to natural disasters... a walking triumph of lost causes & no-longer living legends.

.... little old me \#BarrysLounge will shake you right through the intervals with tingles down your spinal vinyl and some major Twister action too !
